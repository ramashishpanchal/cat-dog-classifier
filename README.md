# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classifier (Tested with Streamlit)

A deep learning project to classify images of cats and dogs using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**, and tested locally using **Streamlit** for an interactive interface.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on building and training a CNN to classify images as either **cat** or **dog**.  
A simple **Streamlit interface** is used locally to test the model by uploading images and viewing predictions in real time.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- ✅ Built with **TensorFlow/Keras**
- 🧠 Uses a custom **CNN** trained on a dataset of cat and dog images
- 🧼 Includes **image preprocessing** and **data augmentation**
- 🖼️ Tested with **Streamlit UI** for interactive local testing
- 💾 Trained model saved and loaded using `.keras` format
